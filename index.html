                    each letter in the input box is converted into an emoji that resembles that letter 
                    (for example, 📍 looks like an i/I).
                    case is ignored, as are all non-alphabetic characters like numbers and punctuation.
                    <br /><br />
                    decipherability determines how much a letter resembles its emoji conversion. 
                    at low decipherability, a J will be converted into a 👌, while at high decipherability
                    a J is converted into a 🗾.
                    <br /><br />
                    chaos determines how variable the decipherability of the conversion is.
                    in other words, it determines how many different emojis a single letter may be converted into.
                    at high chaos, an O might become 💢, 🛑, 🧭, or ⭕. 
                    <br />
                    some letters have very few possible conversions
                    while others have very many; each letter is affected by chaos differently.
